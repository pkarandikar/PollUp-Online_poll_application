# PollUp-Online_poll_application
Created an Online poll application ‘PollUp’. A user can login using credetials and generate a poll of their choice. An end time/date is to be added when the polling would stop and the poll moves to the polled tab instead of currently polling.  In order to simply vote, user doesn't need to login.  All users can see polls by categories due to tags assigned to them, can se trending polls, can see newly added polls. All users can see poll results, statistics. TECHS USED:JSP platform client-side, PHP server-side, HTML, CSS for styling, JQuery for event handling, flow control. Apache Tomcat server for connectivity.
